## Claire's Parrying Dagger

### Details

An inconspicuous dagger, originally owned by Claire the Vampire Hunter. The dagger itself is not particularly deadly, but its tip is covered in sun-soaked gold, which makes even glancing blows deadly to vampires.

This dagger was given as a gift to Woodie Terrafire, for slaying the vampire Joe Byron with Claire's wooden stake.

### Effects

**Vampire Bane:** 
When Woodie attacks a vampire with this dagger, he gains advantage and deals an additional 1d4 radiant damage.

**Parry:** 
Woodie gains +2 AC until the start of his next turn when he takes the Dodge action.
