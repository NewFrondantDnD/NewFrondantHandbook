## Hat of Grappling

### Details

An odd hat that appears to give the user more energy, but only when worn backwards. It is marked with a magical green sigil consisting of three jagged lines.

This hat was sent to Drachmae after his twin brother defeated the vampire terrorizing the Fairwinds countryside and took the hat from the vampire's corpse.

The name "Hat of Grappling" is actually a bit of a misnomer, since the hat boosts all of the users' athletic skills, not just grappling.

### Effects

**Monstrous Energy:** 
Drachmae gains +2 to his athletics checks when he is wearing this hat backwards.
