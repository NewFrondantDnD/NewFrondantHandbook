## Clep

### Description

Clep is a massive, muscular man who is well-known among the adventurers of New Frondant. Due to his high status, he is typically more well-dressed than the average adventurer. Despite his fame, he is known to get drunk and sometimes cause trouble in the Adventurers' Guild tavern.

### New Frondant

Roulef, when looking to demonstrate his crossbow, shot 4 harmless padded bolts at Clep while in the tavern. This enraged Clep, who tried to tackle Drachmae, but repeatedly failed due to his drunkenness. He was later dragged out by the tavern guards, with a warning to Roulef that Clep should not be disrespected.
