## New Frondant

### Description

New Frondant is a mining colony and tourist city, and the first colony of its parent country, Frondant. Its location close to various veins of Mythril makes it both a strategic location for Frondant, but also makes it well sought-after by competing nations. 

It has a port, which is used to send travelers and supplies between New Frondant, Fairwinds, and other port cities. It has an unfinished castle, and three of its four walls are now complete. South of the castle, there is a marketplace, which has all sorts of goods, from mundane household items like flour and matches to magic items. Further out from the marketplace there are the standard residential zones, including restaurants and inns. Going south from the residential area, farmland surrounds the entire city. Just north of the castle, there is a run-down residential zone, presumably the old part of the city.

The New Frondant Adventurers' Guild is located just north of the marketplace.

### New Frondant

Roulef, Woodie, Drachmae and J arrived at New Frondant, and decided to seek out the Adventurers' Guild after receiving a divine intervention from Faeren Promise telling them to go there. Once there, they caused trouble in the Adventurers' Guild Tavern, with Roulef angering Clep, J stealing several silver coins from Walsen, and Woodie attempting to set the tavern on fire with one of his tens of thousands of matches.
