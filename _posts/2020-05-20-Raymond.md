## Raymond

### Description

Raymond is the no-nonsense boss of Roulef. He takes Roulef's job seriously, and reprimanded Roulef for his lateness after the events at the Fairwinds guardhouse. However, despite his interest in Roulef's internship,he doesn't particularly care for Roulef's personal well-being. In his words to Roulef, "If you die, that's no skin off my back."

### New Frondant

His first task to Roulef is to take a Mythril detection orb across the Mythril vein from the nearby forest to the mountain edge, and mark the position where the orb stops glowing. He also recommended to Roulef that he pass his downtime by doing quests for the New Frondant Adventurers' Guild.
