## Walsen

### Description

Walsen is an adventurer drunk who frequents the New Frondant Adventurer's Guild tavern. He seems to have a bone to pick with Clep.

### New Frondant

Walsen suggested to Roulef that he test out his repeating crossbow on Clep when Roulef asked for a target, and clapped in amusement when Clep tried and failed to tackle Drachmae. J was able to steal several silver pieces from Walsen by bringing him a drink, and Woodie gave Walsen a match with the intent to light the tavern on fire. Woodie's plan failed when Walsen ate the match instead.
