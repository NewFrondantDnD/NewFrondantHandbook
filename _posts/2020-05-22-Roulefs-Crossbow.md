## Coronacht, Roulef's Crossbow

### Details

A powerful rapid-fire crossbow, custom-made for Roulef by Roulef's uncle, Frondant's chief engineer. The crossbow is made of the finest materials, and its internal steam-driven power supply allows it to fire several times faster than normal crossbows. On top of this, Roulef can activate its fully automatic firing mode and pepper a target with bolts, but he has to reload Coronacht's barrel manually every time he uses it. This takes about half an hour.

Roulef has also created a Healing Injection module, which allows him to directly inject healing fluids into his skin. Roulef created this device as part of his college studies into mechanical healing devices, despite his parents' complaints that he should create something more fitting for his status.

Roulef most recently developed a retractable blade module that allows him to extend and retract a shortsword from the crossbow's tip with the flip of a switch. The shortsword placed in this device was taken from a guardhouse in Frondant's port city, Fairwinds, when Roulef helped defeat the vampire Joe Byron.

### Effects

**Repeating Crossbow (Crossbow Expert, Level 1):** 
Coronacht is a specially-made repeating crossbow, allowing Roulef to fire two shots at once, ignore the loading property of crossbows, and prevent disadvantage when used at melee range.

**Custom Build (Fighting Style: Archery, Level 1):** 
Coronacht is custom-built for Roulef, giving him +2 to attack rolls.

**Healing Injection (Second Wind, Level 1):** 
Coronacht has a modification that injects Roulef with healing drugs, healing him for 1d10+2 HP as a bonus action. He must refill it during a short rest after each use.

**Rapid-Fire (Action Surge, Level 2):** 
Coronacht has a barrel that stores extra arrows, allowing Roulef to fire even more shots at once. He must reload it during a short rest after each use.

**Grappling Hook (CURRENTLY UNDER REPAIR):** 
Roulef is currently developing a module that allows him to shoot out a grappling hook from an attachment on the crossbow's right side.
