## Fairwinds

### Description

The city of Fairwinds is a bustling trade hub, recently propelled into wealth by the discovery and development of New Frondant. Due to its strategic location, the country of Frondant has set up various security policies to ensure that Fairwinds is protected from a number of threats, both military and magical.

### Prologue

Roulef, Woodie, Drachmae and Claire entered the city and were detained in the gaurdhouse for a day under standard policy for preventing vampires from entering the city. There, they killed the vampire Joe Byron, a trading merchant intending to sell his goods at the Fairwinds trade house who was disguising his true nature.

Later, at the Fairwinds docks, Roulef, Woodie and Drachmae met J, and the party set off to New Frondant in a boat.
