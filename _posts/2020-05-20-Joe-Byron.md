## Joe Byron

### Description

Joe Byron is a noble who became rich off his trading business, Byron's Cosmetics. He is a middle-man who takes orders from other rich nobles who commission custom fashion items, such as hats and parasols. He treats all commoners poorly, including his own artisans, thinking himself above the common rabble.

### Prologue

Joe Byron was revealed to be infected with late-stage vampirism when he arrived at the port town of Fairwinds. He was detained with Roulef, Drachmae, Woodie and Claire at the guardhouse. He later revealed himself as a vampire in an attempt to escape before dawn, and was killed by Woodie with a wooden stake.
